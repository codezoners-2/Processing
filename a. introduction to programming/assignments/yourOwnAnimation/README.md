## yourOwnAnimation
* Create an animated application. You can extend the one from from last week or start something new. In any case it should have the following characteristics:
  * The colors, size, and locations of the elements should be described by variables not static values.
  * Your sketch should have some movement and some color change. At least one of the two should be controlled by the random() function so that each time your work is run it's different.
  * Some element much be affected by the mouse (mouseX, mouseY) and something much happen when you press the mouse (mousePressed() command) or a key in the keyboard (keyPressed() command)
  * Post your sketch on github for all to see
