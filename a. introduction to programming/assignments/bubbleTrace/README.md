Write a program that does [this](http://artech.cc/_class_material_/exercises/week2/exercise1/) (move the mouse to see what itâ€™s doing).

###Step-by-step:

1. Design the program so that it draws a circle where the mouse is (hint: use mouseX, mouseY)

2. Modify the program so that the circles are drawn at a random location within a distance of 30 pixels from where the mouse is (you are going to have to use the random() function)

3. Modify your program so that it generates circles of radius between 5 and 20. (Note: width and height of each random circle you generate has to be equal)

4. Modify your program so that it gives random shades of blue and random alpha (transparency) to the circles
