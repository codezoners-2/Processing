# extendedPhysics:

Write a program that does [this](http://artech.cc/_class_material_/exercises/week4/exercise2_extendedPhysics/) (move the mouse to see what itâ€™s doing).

###Step-by-step:

1. open up the example simplePhysics
2. setup a stepY as we have done for stepX
3. update circleY as you have done for circleX
4. check whether we are outside the boundaries in the Y axis as you have done for the X axis
5. Bonus:
  1. When the ball hits one of the walls make it change color
  2. When the ball hits one of the walls make it become slightly bigger in diameter
