## Conditionals and loops

###coding assignments

#### lab
<ul>
	<li><strong>conditionals:</strong>Complete the assignments <strong>extendedPhysics</strong>, <strong>multipleButtons</strong> and <strong>redZone</strong></li>
	<li><strong>loops:</strong>Complete the assignment <strong>enlargedPixels</strong> </li>
</ul>

#### home
<ul>
	<li>Make your own interactive drawing (an engine, a character, a portrait, a landscape, etc). Your sketch should have all of the following elements:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>movement which has some conditional (example: something should change when the object enters/leaves some area) </li>
		<li>makes use of the mouse (using keyPressed() and key (to read which button was pressed)</li>
		<li>make use of a for loop within another loop (aka nested loop) in order to draw something</li>
		<li>you can use code from a previous week but the result should be significantly different</li>	
	</ul>
</ul>


###reading assignments
<ul>
	<li>From <a href="http://www.artech.cc/_class_material_/books/Getting_Started_with_Processing.pdf"> Getting started with Processing</a> read pg.60-71</li>
    <li>Alternatively, for a more in depth look into conditionals read chapter 5 from <a href="http://www.artech.cc/_class_material_/books/Learning_Processing.pdf">Learning Processing</a></li>
</ul>
