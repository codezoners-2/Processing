</ul>

<ul>

		<li>make use of a for loop within another loop (aka nested loop) in order to draw something</li>
		<li>you can use code from a previous week but the result should be significantly different</li>	
	</ul>
</ul>


###reading assignments
<ul>
	<li>Read Golan Levin's essay <a href="http://www.flong.com/texts/essays/essay_4x4/">Beyond Photoshop with Code</a></li>
	<li>From <a href="http://www.artech.cc/_class_material_/books/Getting_Started_with_Processing.pdf"> Getting started with Processing</a> read up until page 54. <b>Ignore</b> pg. 42-48 as they contain concepts we'll see later.</li>
    <li>Alternatively, if you want a more in depth look into Processing programming you can read optionally read chapters 1-4 from <a href="http://www.artech.cc/_class_material_/books/Learning_Processing.pdf">Learning Processing</a></li>
