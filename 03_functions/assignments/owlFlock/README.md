# owl flock

### step by step

1. Open up a new sketch and copy-paste the code provided. It's a function that draws owls. It takes 3 parameters. The position of the owl (x & y) and a greyscale color (in 255 shades of grey - not 50!).
2. Create a nested loop (for loop inside another for loop) which calls the above function and draws the design in the owlFlock.png image in this directory. The positions are defined by the values that the parameters of the for loop are going to have.
3. Set the owl color to random between 0-100.
4. BONUS: if the mouse is above an hour have that owl turn white
